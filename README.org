#+title: Aabm's literate configuration for GNU Emacs
#+author: aabm

This is my personal configuration for GNU Emacs. It is written in a
literate style, combining code snippets and documentation in the same
file.

I use Emacs as my primary computing interface. I write personal notes
and documents with it, and it is central my academic work. This
configuration is where I set all of that up.

In line with the GNU philosophy, this configuration is entirely Free
Software. See the [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]] file in this repository for more
information.

Some of the major features and characteristics of this configuration
are:

- Declarative package management with ~straight.el~
- Powerful writing workflows with ~org-mode~
- Notetaking according to the /zettelkasten/ method
- Mail, RSS feeds and more!
