This is Aabm's personal configuration for GNU Emacs.

The goal of this configuration is to allow the use of Emacs as an
Integrated Computing Environment, or a Virtual Lisp Machine. This
means Emacs is treated as the primary tool for anything involving the
manipulation of text, and text interfaces are always preferred over
any alternatives.

This configuration covers many use cases. Among these are: writing,
programming, document preparation, reading mail and news feeds, and
much more.

This configuration is organized in a literate style, harnessing the
abilities of org-mode. The entire configuration is contained within
the emacs.org file, and all code is extracted (tangled) into the
files which are to be sourced by Emacs.

In line with the GNU Emacs philosophy, this configuration is entirely
Free Software. See the License file for more details.
