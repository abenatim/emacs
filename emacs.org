* About

Yet another complete rewrite!

This is my =personal configuration for GNU Emacs=. It is
structured in a literate style, meaning it includes documentation and
code in the same file.

I use Emacs for lots of things. I write personal notes and documents
with it. I rely on it for my academic work. I read my mail in it. This
configuration sets that all up for me.

In line with the GNU philosophy, this configuration is entirely =free
software=. See the [[*License:~][License]] section in this file for more details.

This configuration is written with a few key guidelines in mind:

- Don't turn Emacs into a complex monstrosity
- When in doubt, always prefer the simpler implementation
- Try the defaults! They're there for a reason!
- Document all config choices!

* Basic appearance

** Font

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Iosevka 11"))
#+end_src

** Bars

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

** Theme

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t)
#+end_src

* Quality of life

** Disabling backup files

By default, Emacs litters your directories with backups of files
you edit. I find this behavior not only useless but also irritating.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
  (setq make-backup-files nil)
  (setq auto-save-default nil)
#+end_src
